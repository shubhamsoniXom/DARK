This repo targets to ASK & PROVIDE most commonly and repititively used methods in day to day
Data Science activities.

We often practice these two elemenents in our daily jobs:-

**R** : Read, Research & some time Reach-out to others

**I** : Implement, Improvise or Innovate 

let's bring in another element which puts our minds to Peace when it comes to re-development 
of scripts from scratch for every project/PoC.

**P** : Promote Collaboration, Practice sharing, Peer-to-Peer reviews and most importantly 
        Provide faster results to clients.

Data Science Workflow:
This repo is built upon cookiecutter data-science template and can be installed as any other 
python package.

Repo contents:
coming soon!!!
