This repo targets to ASK & PROVIDE most commonly and repititively used methods in day to day
Data Science activities.

We often practice these two elements in our daily job:-

**R** : Read, Research & some times Reach-out to others

**I** : Implement, Improvise or Innovate 

let's bring in another element which puts our minds to Peace when it comes to re-development 
of scripts from scratch for every project/PoC.

**P** : Promote Collaboration, Practice sharing, Peer-to-Peer reviews and most importantly 
        Provide faster results to clients.

Summary:

This repo is built upon cookiecutter data-science template and can be installed as any other 
python package. The repo aims to cover best practices and variety of methods for each step
in Data Science work flow.

Typical DS workflow:

Data Collection > Data Preparation > Exploratory Data analysis > Modeling > Testing > Deployment
